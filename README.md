# chat-application
This is a chat application written in node.JS using Express Framework and socket.io. 

It also has gulp integration. Currently gulp just restarts the server everytime we save changes to index.js file.
           TO-DO: Use browser sync along with gulp so that changes can directly reflect on the client side too.

To implement a basic example of a  CSS preprocessor(LESS)
